====== Restful API handler ======

===== What is this? =====

This is a piece of code to handle API RESTful calls.

The idea is to have a common code to migrate between systems. When you call an endpoint you are calling a class in vendorname/Modules. When you refer to a verb you are calling an method in the object created with this class.

This way you only need to add classes with its methods and you have services.

===== Install =====

==== Prerequisites ====

Apache (or apache like) with rewrite enabled.
A DBRS and mysqli depending on what you want to do (demo class uses a DBRS, DB_connect.php, from //core//, uses mysqli).

==== Steps ====

1. Put this code in a webserver
2. Modify .htaccess
3. Modify config.php
4. Add your own classes

==== Detail ====

=== .htaccess ===

<code>
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ ./api.php?request=$1 [QSA,NC,L]
</IfModule>
</code>
